<h1>3rd T20I: India look to test bench strength after clinching series vs West Indies </h1>

Having already clinched the three-match T20I series, Team India will aim to go for a clean sweep while trying to test its bench strength when they take on West Indies in the final match at the Providence Stadium here on Tuesday.
After registering a four-wicket win in the first T20I, India on Sunday secured a 22-run win by the DLS method in the second T20I in Florida, thereby clinching the series.
After Sunday's win, skipper Virat Kohli hinted that he might experiment with the line-up in Tuesday's game.
